.TH HSH 1 "Simple Shell Manual"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ command ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from either standard input or command line arguments and executes them.

The shell supports both interactive mode (displaying a prompt and waiting for user input) and non-interactive mode (reading commands from pipes or files).

.SH OPTIONS
The shell does not accept any command-line options. If a command is provided as an argument, it will be executed and the shell will exit.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
When running in interactive mode,
.B hsh
displays a prompt ($) and waits for the user to type a command. The command line always ends with a new line. After the command has been executed, the prompt is displayed again.

.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
In non-interactive mode,
.B hsh
reads commands from standard input without displaying a prompt. This mode is useful for executing scripts or commands from pipes.

.SH COMMANDS
Commands can be specified as:
.IP \(bu 3
Absolute paths (e.g., /bin/ls)
.IP \(bu 3
Relative paths (e.g., ./myprogram)
.IP \(bu 3
Executables found in the PATH environment variable (e.g., ls, grep)

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. The optional
.I status
argument specifies the exit status (default is 0).

.TP
.B env
Print all environment variables.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B hsh
inherits the environment from its parent process and can modify it using built-in commands.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
exits with the status of the last command executed. If the exit built-in is used, it exits with the specified status.

.SH EXAMPLES
To use the shell interactively:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
file1 file2 file3
($) exit
$
.fi
.RE
.PP
To use the shell non-interactively:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
file1 file2 file3
.fi
.RE
.PP
To execute a command that doesn't exist:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ ./hsh
($) qwerty
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
($)
.fi
.RE

.SH ERROR MESSAGES
When a command cannot be found,
.B hsh
displays an error message in the format:
.PP
.RS
.I ./hsh: 1: command: not found
.RE
.PP
The exact format matches that of
.BR /bin/sh .
